Companies with expertise in software development need to develop competencies in educational content development if they want to build a platform to teach people a subject. They can't take an existing book's content because of copywrite law, so they write their own. Once they develop their content they will use copyright to protect themselves from another firm coming in with a better product and taking market share. This process repeats forever until a reasonable public domain implementation of a subject gains market acceptance.

Ideally the creation of public domain educational materials empowers others to improve and extend the content, but this is not always easily done. Consider this public domain calculus book that is just scans of pages - https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015000971625&view=1up&seq=9. It would take massive effort to digitize this in HTML, EPUB3, EPUB2, Markdown, reStructuredText, PreTeXt, or some other way of displaying text and formatting on a screen.

Given the variety of formats one could choose to digitize content, which format should we choose? In my view, Markdown is the way to go. It is easy to edit. It has a very simple syntax, which can be limiting, but it is useful to be limited when we have to consider interoperability between systems. It is supported in major cloud-hosted Git repositories like GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab. It is also supported on Piazza! It also can be converted to just about any other format using the Pandoc document converter, whose documentation states that "While conversions from pandoc’s Markdown to all formats aspire to be perfect, conversions from formats more expressive than pandoc’s Markdown can be expected to be lossy." In this sense Markdown is like the universal language for writing documents.

Because of Markdown's support on Git hosting services and ease of use it makes a lot of sense for collaborative authoring of documents. Because of how popular Markdown is there is a rich ecosystem built around extending and modifying it. Unified.js lets you parse markdown to an abstract syntax tree and transform the syntax tree. This is useful for working with markdown programatically. The unified software collective also has software for creating interactive components from markdown files.
