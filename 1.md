Companies with expertise in software development need to develop competencies in educational content development if they want to build a platform to teach people a subject. They can't take an existing book's content because of copywrite law, so they write their own. Once they develop their content they will use copyright to protect themselves from another firm coming in with a better product and taking market share. This process repeats forever until a reasonable public domain implementation of a subject gains market acceptance.

Ideally the creation of public domain educational materials empowers others to improve and extend the content, but this is not always easily done. Consider this public domain calculus book that is just scans of pages - https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015000971625&view=1up&seq=9. It would take massive effort to digitize this in HTML, EPUB3, EPUB2, Markdown, reStructuredText, PreTeXt, or some other way of displaying text and formatting on a screen.

Given the variety of formats one could choose to digitize content, which format should we choose? In my view, Markdown is the way to go. It is easy to edit. It has a very simple syntax, which can be limiting, but it is useful to be limited when we have to consider interoperability between systems. It is supported in major cloud-hosted Git repositories like GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab. It is also supported on Piazza! It also can be converted to just about any other format using the Pandoc document converter, whose documentation states that "While conversions from pandoc’s Markdown to all formats aspire to be perfect, conversions from formats more expressive than pandoc’s Markdown can be expected to be lossy." In this sense Markdown is like the universal language for writing documents.

Because of Markdown's support on Git hosting services and ease of use it makes a lot of sense for collaborative authoring of documents. Because of how popular Markdown is there is a rich ecosystem built around extending and modifying it. Unified.js lets you parse markdown to an abstract syntax tree and transform the syntax tree. This is useful for working with markdown programatically. The unified software collective also has software for creating interactive components from markdown files.

  * Summary: The Gini Coefficient is a way of measuring inequality, traditionally in economics but it can be used in collaborative content authoring. Less than 10% of the authors on Wikipedia contribute over 90% of the contents. The Gini coefficient calculated for each month's contributions tends to remain stable.
  * Main takeaways: A single contributor can be really valuable if they are dedicated. An extension of this is the Gini coefficient for open source projects. A more specific extension is the gini coefficient for learning/knowledge repositories on GitHub.

 * Summary: Stackoverflow users were surveyed to see what metrics associated with a GitHub repository they think are important. It was found that stars are considered more important than forks or watchers. Data driven guidance is given on how to get more stars on your GitHub repositories, like social media promotion and repository activity.
 * Main takeaways: I need to get stars on my GitHub repositories if I want to gain market acceptance. I should promote my repositories on social media, like Medium. I also need to keep the project maintained and continue to push new updates.

  * Summary: This is an investigation into data quality issues that arise when mining data from GitHub. It was found that "...almost 40% of all pullrequests do not appear as merged, even though they were.". Some analysis was done as well, most projects are personal projects, most projects are inactive, and many projects are not actually software but just files being hosted on GitHub.
  * Main takeaways: Be wary when mining GitHub to see contribution patterns. It references people doing things off of GitHub that might not be tracked, I am not familiar with these workflows. If many projects are inactive it might be worth understanding the death of a project.

 * Summary: This is a comparison of OEBPS and PDF. Detailed descriptions of OEBPS and PDF are given. An E-Book standard should be interoperable, extensible, applicable, and vendor independent.
 * Main takeaways: These formats are really complex compared to what I've built. It is similar to the way Markdown itself is simpler than anything else. I can cite this paper to talk about how great my software is by the standards given in the paper.

 * Google Scholar but I been known about it.
 * Summary: Runestone uses a Python documentation framework called Sphinx to compile reStructuredText to HTML and has custom directives to create interactive components within the HTML. This system produces detailed logs and has been used for a number of studies. It is under active development and has a substantial user base.
 * Main takeaways: This is the cutting edge in interactive books. I feel like using using Python and Sphinx will result in an accumulation of technical debt. It will also be very hard to find people that are skilled in writing custom Sphinx directives. But everything is technical debt in the long term lol.
