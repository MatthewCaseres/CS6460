Companies with expertise in software development need to develop competencies in educational content development if they want to build a platform to teach people a subject. They can't take an existing book's content because of copywrite law, so they write their own. Once they develop their content they will use copyright to protect themselves from another firm coming in with a better product and taking market share. This process repeats forever until a reasonable public domain implementation of a subject gains market acceptance.

Ideally the creation of public domain educational materials empowers others to improve and extend the content, but this is not always easily done. Consider this public domain calculus book that is just scans of pages - https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015000971625&view=1up&seq=9. It would take massive effort to digitize this in HTML, EPUB3, EPUB2, Markdown, reStructuredText, PreTeXt, or some other way of displaying text and formatting on a screen.

Given the variety of formats one could choose to digitize content, which format should we choose? In my view, Markdown is the way to go. It is easy to edit. It has a very simple syntax, which can be limiting, but it is useful to be limited when we have to consider interoperability between systems. It is supported in major cloud-hosted Git repositories like GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab. It is also supported on Piazza! It also can be converted to just about any other format using the Pandoc document converter, whose documentation states that "While conversions from pandoc’s Markdown to all formats aspire to be perfect, conversions from formats more expressive than pandoc’s Markdown can be expected to be lossy." In this sense Markdown is like the universal language for writing documents.

Because of Markdown's support on Git hosting services and ease of use it makes a lot of sense for collaborative authoring of documents. Because of how popular Markdown is there is a rich ecosystem built around extending and modifying it. Unified.js lets you parse markdown to an abstract syntax tree and transform the syntax tree. This is useful for working with markdown programatically. The unified software collective also has software for creating interactive components from markdown files.

  * Page 325 has some discussion of categories/clustering for usefulness and ease of use. They define a test to generate metrics for userfulness and ease of use. This is then found to be correlated with predicted use of a technology.

  * Summary: The Gini Coefficient is a way of measuring inequality, traditionally in economics but it can be used in collaborative content authoring. Less than 10% of the authors on Wikipedia contribute over 90% of the contents. The Gini coefficient calculated for each month's contributions tends to remain stable.
  * Main takeaways: A single contributor can be really valuable if they are dedicated. An extension of this is the Gini coefficient for open source projects. A more specific extension is the gini coefficient for learning/knowledge repositories on GitHub.

  * Summary: Stackoverflow users were surveyed to see what metrics associated with a GitHub repository they think are important. It was found that stars are considered more important than forks or watchers. Data driven guidance is given on how to get more stars on your GitHub repositories, like social media promotion and repository activity.
  * Main takeaways: I need to get stars on my GitHub repositories if I want to gain market acceptance. I should promote my repositories on social media, like Medium. I also need to keep the project maintained and continue to push new updates.

  * Summary: This is an investigation into data quality issues that arise when mining data from GitHub. It was found that "...almost 40% of all pullrequests do not appear as merged, even though they were.". Some analysis was done as well, most projects are personal projects, most projects are inactive, and many projects are not actually software but just files being hosted on GitHub.
  * Main takeaways: Be wary when mining GitHub to see contribution patterns. It references people doing things off of GitHub that might not be tracked, I am not familiar with these workflows. If many projects are inactive it might be worth understanding the death of a project.

  * Summary: This is a comparison of OEBPS and PDF. Detailed descriptions of OEBPS and PDF are given. An E-Book standard should be interoperable, extensible, applicable, and vendor independent.
  * Main takeaways: These formats are really complex compared to what I've built. It is similar to the way Markdown itself is simpler than anything else. I can cite this paper to talk about how great my software is by the standards given in the paper.

  * Summary: A book with embedded videos and a runnable code editor was created with Sphinx. Interactive visualization of code is possible with this system. 88% of the students reported that the interactive nature of classtime helped them learn.
  * Main takeaways: This is the beginning of the Runestone project. Having students use the software was an important part of the publication. Some involvement with CSLearning4U group at Georgia Tech, director of group Mark Guzdial is now at Michigan.

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366950
  * Google Scholar but I been known about it.
  * Summary: Runestone uses a Python documentation framework called Sphinx to compile reStructuredText to HTML and has custom directives to create interactive components within the HTML. This system produces detailed logs and has been used for a number of studies. It is under active development and has a substantial user base.
  * Main takeaways: This is the cutting edge in interactive books. I feel like using using Python and Sphinx will result in an accumulation of technical debt. It will also be very hard to find people that are skilled in writing custom Sphinx directives. But everything is technical debt in the long term lol.

  * Summary: The bookroll system gives you learning analytics. These analytics are used to predict who will be a high performing or low performing student. Predictions made from a machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 80% by the third week of the course.
  * Main takeaways: Providing analytics to an educator for an electronic book is a good idea. I am unable to find more information about the bookroll system. Being able to make something like PDF format rich with analytics seems very valuable.

  * Summary: Digital first authoring workflow reduces cost of publishing an EPUB. Graceful fallback for rich content when displayed in unsupported environment. Semantic markup is written initially.
  * Main takeaways: What does the fallback look like for a multiple choice question? What is the authoring experience like? Can we publish to print?

  * Summary: Ebooks let you do a full-text search. The authors feel that indexing is an important part of books. Many ebooks don't have indices.
  * Main takeaways: The authors of this article are both freelance indexers so they have a personal bias. I suppose a full-text search would return too many results to easily look through and you might need to actually know where the main article on something is. Derivatives might appear throughout a calculus book but the index will tell you the main place, but so will the table of contents, I am not convinced.

  * Students don't use electronic textbooks in a different way than they would use paper books. The electronic books provide some advanced note taking features and analytics features for instructors that paper books do not. The electronic book can and should go beyond the capabilities of a paper book.
  * This paper seems to have been answered by Miller when he had 90% of students wanting to use a book similar to the Runestone book. The small sample size limits the conclusions that can be made. They found no relationship between time spent reading and performance in class, in contrast to the researchers who built a machine learning model to do this.

    * Summary: McGraw-Hill developed an interactive electronic book for learning Pascal. This book was developed as a Java Applet. Students tended to use sequential navigation over free navigation/hyperlinks.
    * Main takeaways: Make sure people don't have to learn how your book works. Students are more relaxed being able to practice independently without the instructor watching. Students appreciate receiving feedback about their stuff.

  * Summary: 8 criteria for determining if a new technology makes an old technology obsolete is given. Electronic books are found to not make paper books obsolete. As of 2001 screens are still not good, ebooks are not standardized.
  * Main takeaways: The 8 criteria are a good reference. But it is worth noting that you don't need to make an old technology obsolete to get good market share. It is funny when they say electronic books are not durable, since I think the stuff on my Google drive will be around for a long time.

    * Summary: A qualitative study was done on city council members and another on students taking a marketing class. For the city council members they needed to reimagine their workflow for how to organize their document collection in a reasonable way. Both groups found themselves wanting to annotate or mark-up their documents as they would on paper.
    * Main takeaways: Annotation is difficult to think about in the context of a document that might change. I wish they knew what websites look like for e-learning. Especially websites with built in learning.
